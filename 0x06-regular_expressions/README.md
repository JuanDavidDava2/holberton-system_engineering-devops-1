# 0x06. Regular expression
In this topic we learn about regular expressions and how to use it.
We have to build our regular expression using Oniguruma, a regular expression 
library that which is used by Ruby by default.

**_Example_**

```
#!/usr/bin/env ruby
puts ARGV[0].scan(/127.0.0.[0-9]/).join

```

## Requirements
+ Allowed editors: `vi, vim, emacs`
+ All your files will be interpreted on `Ubuntu 14.04 LTS`
+ All your files should end with a new line
+ A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
+ All your Bash script files must be executable
+ The first line of your Bash scripts should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/env ruby`
+ All your regex must be built for the `Oniguruma` library
