# 0x0D. Web stack debugging #0
The Webstack debugging series will train you in the art of debugging. Computers and software rarely work the way we want (thats the fun part of the job!).

Being able to debug a webstack is essential for a Full-Stack Software Engineer, and it takes practice to be a master of it.

In this debugging series, broken/bugged webstacks will be given to you, the final goal is to come up with a Bash script that once executed, will bring the webstack to a working state. But before writing this Bash script, you should figure out what is going on and fix it manually.

## Requirements

+ Allowed editors: `vi, vim, emacs`
+ All your files will be interpreted on `Ubuntu 14.04 LTS`
+ All your files should end with a new line
+ All your Bash script files must be executable
+ Your Bash scripts must pass `Shellcheck` without any error
+ Your Bash scripts must run without error
+ The first line of all your Bash scripts should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/env bash`
+ The second line of all your Bash scripts should be a comment.
